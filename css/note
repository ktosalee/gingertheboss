<!-- --------------------- Display
1. Block
  * Can change "width" and "height" but it won't work if we put "Display" as "Inline"
    Block elements
      - Paragraphs (<p>)
      - Headers (<h1> through <h6>)
      - Divisions (<div>)
      - Lists and list items (<ol>, <ul>, <li>)
      - Forms (<form>)

2. Inline
  * Can't change "width" and "height" but it will work if we put "Display" as "Inline"
    Inline elements
      - Spans (<span>)
      - images (<img>)
      - Anchors (<a>)

3. Inline-Block
  * Can change "width" and "height" and also it will work if we put "Display-inline"
  so as the same elements it will stick together in the same line and then block
  another elements in that particular line.

4.None
  * "Display: None" is removing that element like it's never been existing in the page.
  * "Visibility: hidden" it will make that element disappear but it keep the original
  position of that element like it still there but just can't see it.
------------------ -->



<!-- ----------------------- Position
The position element will be worked only with Coordinates elements.

Coordinates Element:
  - top
  - bottom
  - left
  - right


1. Static
  * Default working followed by HTML style

2. Relative
  * Relate to only particular element such as
    img {
      position: relative;
      left: 200px;
    }

    Means that the position of that img is related to each other in specific element
    only by itself(no parent) and it will count from left of the img and go to the right for 200px.

3. Absolute
  * Relate to only particular element such as
    img {
      position: absolute;
      top: 200px;
    }

    Means that the position of that img is related to the whole body(in this case means
    'body' which is parent of 'body' than itself) and it will effect to all other elements to got moved.

    It will count from top of the body and stay away form the top of the page for 200px
    means that it will appear below of the page for 200px.

4. Fixed
  * To fixed that particular element without moving when scrolling up or down from the page
    img {
      position: fixed;
      top: 0px;
    }

    Means it will stay on the top always even we scroll the page down
------------------ -->


<!-- ----------------------- font-size
  16px = 100% = 1em

There are 3 types to choose:
1. px
  example:
    body = font-size = 20px
    h1 = font-size = 90px
      * h1 stay in 90px
      * means that it's not related to their parent

    - In case that a user set font size default of Chrome to be smaller or larger than normal size,
      the h1 size will not change even though other font size in body part has changed

2. %

    - In case that a user set font size default of Chrome to be smaller or larger than normal size,
      the h1 size will change by the proper scale font size with body part

3. em (rem)
  example:
    body = font-size = 1em
    h1 = font-size = 5em
      * h1 size will be 5 times bigger that body font size
      * means that it's related to their parent font size

    - In case that a user set font size default of Chrome to be smaller or larger than normal size,
      the h1 size will not change even though other font size in body part has changed

    # In case we use 'rem' instead of just 'em', h1 will stick in that number and
      don't care about it's parent(which is body font size)
